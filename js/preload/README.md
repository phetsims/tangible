### Mechamarkers as an input controller to PhET Interactive Simulations


Beginning in early 2020, the PhET accessibility team began to prototype and research using tangibles
 to interact with a phetsim. This folder houses the code to begin this process within the confines of 
 Gravity Force Lab. 
 
 It relies on the mechamarkers library (https://github.com/atlas-acme-lab/mechamarkers-boilerplate/)
 and uses specific markers to control the simulation.
